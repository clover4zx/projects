            <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
            <p>I'm very proud of the website I created, as I have been doing this assignment throughout the time I was given to complete it. 
             This website is a good representation of who I am as a person and it reflects my personality through the blue designs and intricate stars. I find the design to be appealing and minamalistic, 
             having clean elements and void of any chaotic or clunky objects within the website. This website consists of a range of navy to pastel blues, as I find an effective website design to be calming in the eyes. 
             This website is easily accessible and to navigate, making it suitable for mobile and desktop use.</p>
