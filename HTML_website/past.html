                    <h2>Visual Arts was one of the subjects I studied during year 11 and 12</h2>
                    <p>It was one of my favourite subjects, as I enjoyed analysing artists and their paintings. 
                    Theodore Gericault was one of the artists I studied, and he painted "The Raft of the Medusa" on the year 1819. 
                    I also studied the artist Francisco De Goya, who painted "The Third of May 1808" on the year 1814.</p>

                    <h2>I participated in volunteer events my school provided</h2>
                    <p>It was just some simple fund raising events and tidying up the classrooms. It gave me opportunities to get involved with my school community, which I really enjoyed as my friends attended these volunteer events with me.</p>

                    <h2>During lunch at school, I sometimes play chess with one of my friends</h2>
                    <p>I improved after every match, although I stopped playing much after I graduated from highschool. I mostly lost to my friend, however I still had fun playing chess with her. I surprisingly found it enjoyable and a competetive game. </p>
